# Mostek MK38P73 Single Board Computer
A simple single board computer based on the Mostek MK38P73 MCU. The MK38P73 is a variation of the Mostek MK38P70 which contains a hardware serial port. The MK38P70 is the "piggyback" version of the Mostek's MK3870 which is a second generation refinement of the Fairchild F8 MCU. In addition to the serial port, the MK38P73 features 32 bits of I/O, 64 bytes of 'scratchpad' RAM, 64 bytes of 'executable' RAM and a binary timer.
